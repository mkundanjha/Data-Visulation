# Data-Visulation
This is a data visualisation  project. 
This is basically intended to get response of the food taste to individual persons, 
record their response and then visualise this using a bar chart. 

The test case for this is a Hostel messs.
The response of user is recorded on daily basis.
This is stored is a spreadsheet. This is then used to analyze how the people response 
is about the taste about the food item prepared the respective day.

This is used to plot a bar chart. This chart can give information to respective departments
on how well the food is made every day.

to make future predictions and recommendations to the department to improve the food quality
and taste as per users liking.
